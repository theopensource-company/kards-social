# Kards social

Hiya! üëã <br>
Welcome to the Kards social GitHub repo! We have some little helpers to get you started with our project.

<br>

## CLI tools

**Warning:** Make sure to always run the cli tools from the root of the project. Don't CD into the cli folder to execute them!

We have written some cli tools to make it easier to get started with the project!

- `pnpm conf`: Run this as the first command and follow the instructions it provides you. This will setup all of the environments and config files.
- `pnpm dbshell`: It's a little tool to connect with the database that you configured with `pnpm conf`.
- `pnpm dev`: Spins up the full development stack.

## Database 

We use SurrealDB as our main database. Alongside that we also use cloudflare KV at times to store things.

For your development database, please **do not run it locally**. <br>
Even though you spin up a local working environment, the cloudflare worker still does some stuff on the edge. It will not be able to reach a local surrealdb instance!

<br>
