# Kards social

Hiya! üëã <br>
Welcome to the Kards social GitHub repo! We have a little guide to get you started with our project.

<br>

## Requirements

- The surreal CLI tool. Follow instructions via: https://surrealdb.com/install
  - Make sure the it's installed globally in your PATH.
- A sendgrid api key if you want to be able to send emails

## Getting started

**Warning:** Don't run the CLI tools directly. Use the pnpm scripts to run them to ensure that they will be properly executed.

- Install all the packages with `pnpm i`.
- Run `pnpm dev` in the root of the repo to spin up the full development stack. <br>
  This will launch the nextjs development server and a local surrealdb instance.
- Open the devtools (http://localhost:12000/dev) and run the database migration for the first run, or when you make changes to the schema.
- Go back to the devtools and open the admin panel. <br>
  The database migration created the following admin account for you: 
    - Email: `admin@kards.local`
    - Password: `Password1!`
- Edit the environment keys. Don't touch the origin key though, this is only needed to enfore a domain for production instances!
- Create a user account for yourself, you can now sign into the account and use the full application!
